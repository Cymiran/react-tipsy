# react-tipsy

A React component that allows you to easily create simple tooltips.

Inspired by Bootstrap's jQuery tooltip plugin, which drew its inspiration
from the jQuery.tipsy plugin written by Jason Frame, react-tipsy is a
simple component that allows you to easily add tooltips to any React
component.

Like bootstrap's tooltip plugin, react-tipsy does not rely on images.

## Install

```bash
npm install react-tipsy --save
```

and make sure to include the `react-tipsy.css` stylesheet.
